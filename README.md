# .github

This repository contains organization-wide community files and configuration for GitHub.

## Purpose

The `.github` repository is used to define default files and settings that apply to all repositories within the organization or user account. This helps ensure consistent documentation and contribution standards across all projects.

## Notes

- Files in this repository automatically apply to all other repositories in the same organization or user account unless overridden locally.  
- This repository should not contain project-specific source code.
